== COMMENTS

Although the report mentions that Clearview is keen to focus on ways the technology has helped police
and Clearview uses and produces a number of advanced technologies to correctly recognize peoples' faces indeed,
I think it is not interesting as they collect the peoples' images as the data set without authorization. 
Probably the justice will take advantage of it, by contrast, the evil can do it as well.
