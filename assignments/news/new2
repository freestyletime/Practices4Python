== AGENT

UC Davis

== GOAL

A system that scans animal rehabilitation center data could provide early alerts when a disease is spreading.

== DATA

The researchers used five years of data and more than 200,000 records to establish baselines for how frequently these conditions normally occur.

== METHODS

Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning

== RESULTS

The system processes rehab center admission data in just a day or two, it can produce “prediagnostic” alerts, 
which are faster than waiting until diagnoses have been confirmed.

== ISSUES

This report doesn't mention the trouble that the system meets while developing.
Before the relevant people use the system, they used to record every problem on paper.
you’d have to go through boxes and boxes of paperwork to figure out what you gave that golden eagle 10 years ago.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

I suppose the system is so cool which can not only help people detect most of the problems but sharply improve the efficiency of the work process.
What the most important thing is it can save animals by using this new method, therefore I hope this can be widely applied.
Although the original data is hard to be extracted, researchers use the technology of natural language processing to deal with it successfully.
