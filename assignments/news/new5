== AGENT

Warsaw University of Technology

== GOAL

Play the Lord of the Rings (LotR) classic card game.

== DATA

Evaluated the technique they developed in a series of tests, carried out on a game simulator.

== METHODS

Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), Reinforcement Learning

== RESULTS

Achieved a significantly higher win rate than a rule-based expert player.

== ISSUES

The main problem is that MCTS merges game logic with the AI algorithm, 
so you have to know the legal moves when you are building a game tree.
Debugging for game trees with significant branching factor is a nightmare. 
There were many cases in which the program ran smoothly, but the win rate was zero, 
and had to examine the whole tree manually.

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

I think it is pretty awful because I realize that someday when I am playing a video game,
I never know the opposite players are whether people or not. 
If my opponents are computers, I absolutely lose the game no matter what ways I do.
The trained computer is qualified to defeat the human in the specified area cause it knows all paths to win beforehand.
If let me do this thing, I will remain a method that people can defeat it.
They use simulator, a independent game environment, to train their model correctly by tens of thousands of Trial and error,
which is general but effective.
