== GOAL

Being able to find items in a chaotic world.

== DATA

RFID tags, which are cheap, battery-less tags that can be stuck to an item and reflect signals sent by an antenna. 
Because RF signals can travel through most surfaces (like the mound of dirty laundry that may be obscuring the keys), 
RFusion is able to locate a tagged item within a pile.

== METHODS

Reinforcement Learning

== RESULTS

Using machine learning, the robotic arm automatically zeroes-in on the object’s exact location, 
moves the items on top of it, grasps the object, and verifies that it picked up the right thing. 
The camera, antenna, robotic arm, and AI are fully integrated, 
so RFusion can work in any environment without requiring a special set up.

== ISSUES

While finding lost keys is helpful, RFusion could have many broader applications in the future, 
like sorting through piles to fulfill orders in a warehouse, 
identifying and installing components in an auto manufacturing plant, 
or helping an elderly individual perform daily tasks in the home, 
though the current prototype isn’t quite fast enough yet for these uses.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It is interesting I think, because the initial idea for the researcher is just finds something he needed in the jumble.
As the research goes deeply, they find this idea can be used in many fields, which can help peoples’ life better.
The training way is also how our brain learns. We get rewarded from our teachers, from our parents, from a computer game, etc. 
The same thing happens in reinforcement learning.
