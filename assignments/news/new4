== GOAL

More sustainable and higher performing roads are still possible even with today’s limited budgets.

== DATA

The model begins by investigating every segment in an entire pavement network and predicting future possibilities for pavement deterioration, cost, and traffic.
Run thousands of simulations for each segment in the network to determine the likely cost and performance outcomes for each initial and subsequent sequence, or ‘path,’ of treatment actions.

== METHODS

Machine Learning, Probabilistic Treatment Path Dependence(PTPD)

== RESULTS

The PTPD model not only seeks to minimize costs to agencies but also to users — in this case, drivers.
The MIT model can help DOTs make better decisions, but that decision-making is ultimately constrained by the potential options considered.

== ISSUES

The average road must last many years and support the traffic of thousands — if not millions — of vehicles. 
Over that time, a lot can change. Material prices may fluctuate, budgets may tighten, and traffic levels may intensify. 
Climate (and climate change), too, can hasten unexpected repairs.
Managing these uncertainties effectively means looking long into the future and anticipating possible changes.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I think it is complicated but interesting because constructions are linked to many factors and are full of uncertainty.
And it seems that this model is successful to deal with it.
I do not know how they achieve it, but this is good news both for governments and residents.
In my opinion, it also can be applied in railway construction.
